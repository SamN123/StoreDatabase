   - added LIMIT clauses to prevent excessive data retrieval
   - created aggregated views for summary data

## Implementation Details

### Database Indexing

The application now uses strategic indexes to improve query performance:

1. **Primary Indexes**
   - existing primary keys on `PersonID`, `ProductID`, and `TransactionID`

2. **Secondary Indexes**
   - `idx_purchase_personid` on `Purchase.PersonID` for faster customer history queries
   - `idx_purchase_date` on `Purchase.Date` for improved date-based sorting
   - `idx_products_price` on `Products.ItemPrice` for price-based filtering
   - `idx_persons_email` on `Persons.Email` for faster customer lookup

3. **Composite Indexes**
   - `idx_purchase_person_date` on `Purchase(PersonID, Date)` for optimized customer history

### Optimized Views

Several views have been created to optimize common data access patterns:

1. **RecentPurchasesLimited**
   - shows the most recent 100 purchases with customer and product details
   - includes calculated total price for each purchase
   - optimized for dashboard display

2. **CustomerPurchaseSummary**
   - aggregates purchase data by customer
   - provides total transactions, items purchased, and amount spent
   - includes last purchase date for recency analysis

3. **ProductSalesAnalysis**
   - aggregates sales data by product
   - shows times sold, total quantity sold, and total revenue
   - helps identify best-selling and underperforming products

### Stored Procedures

The application now uses stored procedures for complex operations:

1. **GetPaginatedProducts**
   - retrieves products with pagination support
   - allows sorting by different columns and directions
   - returns total count for pagination controls

2. **GetCustomerPurchaseHistory**
   - retrieves purchase history for a specific customer with pagination
   - includes product details and calculated total prices
   - returns total count for pagination controls

3. **SearchProducts**
   - implements flexible product search with multiple criteria
   - supports name search, price range filtering, and stock availability
   - optimizes result ordering for relevance

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**
   - all list views now support pagination to limit data retrieval
   - default page size of 10 items prevents excessive data transfer
   - total count queries help with pagination controls

2. **Specific Column Selection**
   - replaced `SELECT *` with specific column selection
   - reduces data transfer and improves query performance
   - ensures only necessary data is retrieved

3. **Optimized Joins**
   - all joins use indexed columns for better performance
   - join order optimized for query execution plans
   - reduced unnecessary joins where possible

4. **Calculated Fields**
   - added calculated fields like total price in queries
   - reduces need for client-side calculations
   - improves data consistency

## Usage Examples

### Paginated Product Listing

```java
// View products with pagination
try (Connection connection = getConnection();
     CallableStatement stmt = connection.prepareCall("{CALL GetPaginatedProducts(?, ?, ?, ?)}")) {
    
    // set parameters for the stored procedure
    stmt.setInt(1, page);          // page number
    stmt.setInt(2, pageSize);      // items per page
    stmt.setString(3, sortColumn); // column to sort by
    stmt.setString(4, sortDirection); // sort direction (ASC/DESC)
    
    // execute and process results
    boolean hasResults = stmt.execute();
    if (hasResults) {
        // display products from first result set
        try (ResultSet rs = stmt.getResultSet()) {
            // process product data
        }
        
        // get total count from second result set
        if (stmt.getMoreResults()) {
            try (ResultSet countRs = stmt.getResultSet()) {
                // process count data for pagination
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Product Search with Multiple Criteria

```java
// Search products with multiple criteria
try (Connection connection = getConnection();
     CallableStatement stmt = connection.prepareCall("{CALL SearchProducts(?, ?, ?, ?)}")) {
    
    // set parameters for the stored procedure
    stmt.setString(1, nameSearch);  // product name to search for
    
    // handle optional parameters
    if (minPrice != null) {
        stmt.setFloat(2, minPrice);
    } else {
        stmt.setNull(2, Types.FLOAT);
    }
    
    if (maxPrice != null) {
        stmt.setFloat(3, maxPrice);
    } else {
        stmt.setNull(3, Types.FLOAT);
    }
    
    stmt.setBoolean(4, inStockOnly);  // filter for in-stock items only
    
    // execute and process results
    try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery()) {
        // process search results
    }
}
```

### Customer Purchase Summary

```java
// View customer purchase summary
String query = "SELECT * FROM CustomerPurchaseSummary WHERE PersonID = ?";

try (Connection conn = getConnection();
     PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query)) {
    
    stmt.setInt(1, customerId);
    
    try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery()) {
        if (rs.next()) {
            // display customer information
            System.out.println("Customer ID: " + rs.getInt("PersonID"));
            System.out.println("Name: " + rs.getString("FName") + " " + rs.getString("LName"));
            
            // display purchase summary
            System.out.println("Total Transactions: " + rs.getInt("TotalTransactions"));
            System.out.println("Total Items Purchased: " + rs.getInt("TotalItemsPurchased"));
            System.out.println("Total Amount Spent: $" + rs.getDouble("TotalSpent"));
            System.out.println("Last Purchase Date: " + rs.getTimestamp("LastPurchaseDate"));
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Considerations

When testing the optimized queries, consider:

1. **Performance Testing**
   - test with larger datasets to verify scalability
   - measure query execution time before and after optimization
   - verify index usage with query execution plans

2. **Functional Testing**
   - verify pagination works correctly at boundaries
   - test search functionality with various criteria combinations
   - ensure sorting options work as expected

3. **Edge Cases**
   - test with empty result sets
   - verify behavior with maximum page sizes
   - check performance with complex search criteria
